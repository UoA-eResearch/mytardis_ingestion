# Datafile template. Please replace <key> with the metadata keys defined in the schema and <value> with its value

# Datafiles are a little different as they tend to be defined in blocks of files that are all associated with the same dataset
# If no dataset_id is needed as there is a well defined directory structure, and there is no file specific metadata, then this
# file can be left blank.

# Necessary info
