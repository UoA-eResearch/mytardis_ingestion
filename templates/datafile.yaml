# Datafile template. Please replace <key> with the metadata keys defined in the schema and <value> with its value
#
# Datafiles are a little different as they tend to be defined in blocks of files that are all associated with the same dataset
# If no dataset_id is needed as there is a well defined directory structure, and there is no file specific metadata, then this
# file can be left blank.
#
# Blocks of files can be tagged with the same dataset ids by defining a fileblock as shown below. Multiple fileblocks can be defined
# but these need unique keys, for example block_1:, block_2:
#
# Necessary info
block_1:
  # If a rigorous directory structure is used then this can be inferred from the directory and only needs explicit definition if multiple samples are associated with the dataset
  dataset_id: <the identifier associated with the dataset that this file is part of>
  # schema: <value> - un-comment if multiple schema have been defined and set the appropriate type of schema
  files:
    - name: <file_name>
      #
      # Access control. Access, unless specified otherwise, cascades from the dataset associated with the file.
      # If different access controls are needed, they need to be explicitly defined.
