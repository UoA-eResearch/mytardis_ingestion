<p>The University of Auckland (UoA) has instantiated a customised version of <a class="reference external" href="https://mytardis.org">MyTardis</a> as a repository to hold data generated by scientific instruments. As part of the project developing this capability, we have created a set of ingestion scripts that can be used to automate the process of adding data to the repository.</p>
<p>Our focus in developing these scripts has been to ensure the greatest possible flexibility so we can integrate as seamlessly as possible into existing workflows that are used by facilities.</p>
<div class="section" id="scope">
<h2>Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#scope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This document is intended to describe in detail the processes developed at UoA, by which a new instrument is onboarded into the system. As part of this discussion, the ingestion scripts need tailoring to fit the new instrument in order to gain the greatest possible benefit from automation that can be achieved.</p>
<p>To facilitate the changes necessary to tailor the ingestion scripts, the core Python classes developed are described in more detail and an example ingestion script is included.</p>

<h1>Onboarding a New Instrument<a class="headerlink" href="#onboarding-a-new-instrument" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The process of onboarding a new instrument has developed organically as work has continued customising and implementing the UoA specific version of MyTardis. The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/UoA-eResearch/mytardis">codebase</a> used at UoA has diverged significantly from the upstream but has, at the time of writing this document, been substantially refactored to be compatible with upstream.</p>
<p>During this refactoring process most of the customisation applied at UoA have been moved into ‘apps’, or micro-services. The current list of ‘apps’ that are used (currently not available upstream but future pull requests should make them more widely available for the MyTardis community) are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>project</p></li>
<li><p>instrument_profile</p></li>
<li><p>identifiers</p></li>
<li><p>search</p></li>
<li><p>facility_profile</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The ingestion scripts developed employ these apps and are therefore incompatible with ‘vanilla’ MyTardis. Where possible specific code that relies on one of these apps has been identified.</p>
<div class="section" id="onboarding-steps">
<h2>Onboarding Steps<a class="headerlink" href="#onboarding-steps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are several stages to the onboarding process and it is, by its nature, iterative. Broadly speaking the steps involved consist of the following, which are discussed in more detail</p>

<p>Most researchers and facility managers are not aware of MyTardis and what the instrument data repository offers. In order to ensure that both the facility managers and the researchers are fully engaged with the co-design process it is important to provide them with context. This is typically done by meeting, either individually or as a group and going through the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>What are we trying to achieve with our repository?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Protect data by ensuring that it is backed up in the data centre.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that a set of raw data is collected as ‘close’ to the instrument as possible, allowing for repetition of different analyses for reproducible research.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide search functionality allowing researchers to find their own, and UoA shared data, quickly and easily.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide secured access to data that is in need of protection through robust access control.</p></li>
<li><p>Automate, as much as is possible, the hand-over of data from a facility to researchers</p></li>
</ul>

<p>After holding preliminary discussions, if there is still interest in pursuing the use of MyTardis, the co-design process begins.</p>

<div class="section" id="gathering-required-data">
<span id="gathering-data"></span><h2>Gathering Required Data<a class="headerlink" href="#gathering-required-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When onboarding a new instrument we have made the choice to implement instrument persistent identifiers (PIDs). Current best practice is to use the <cite>schema &lt;https://github.com/rdawg-pidinst/schema/blob/master/schema.rst&gt;</cite> defined by the Research Data Alliance (RDA) working group on persistent identifiers for instruments (PIDInst). The <em>instrument_profile</em> app developed for the UoA instance of MyTardis provides a database model that captures this schema, while retaining the flexibility for facilities to define their own metadata.</p>
<p>The data required to mint an instrument PID is summarised here:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Landing Page</strong>: A URL that the identifier resolves to.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Name</strong>: The instrument name</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Owner</strong>: The institution(s) responsible for the management of the instrument</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Owner Name</strong>: The full name of the owner</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Manufacturer</strong>: The manufacturer or developer of the instrument</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Manufacturer Name</strong>: The full name of the manufacturer</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Other recommended metadata fields defined in the schema include:</dt><dd><ul>
<li><p><strong>Owner</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Owner Contact</strong>: Contact email for the instrument owner</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Owner Identifier</strong>: Persistent identifier (PID) for the instrument owner</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Owner Identifier Type</strong>: The type of PID included.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Manufacturer</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Manufacturer Identifier</strong> PID for the manufacturer</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Manufacturer Identifier Type</strong>: The type of PID included</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Model</strong>: Name or model of the instrument as attributed by the manufacturer</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Model Name</strong>: Full name of the Model</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Identifier</strong>: PID for the model</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Identifier Type</strong>: The type of PID included</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Description</strong>: Technical description of the instrument and its capabilities</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Instrument Type</strong>: Classification of the type of instrument</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Measured Variable</strong>: What the instrument measures or observes</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Date</strong>: Key dates include commissioning/decommissioning, calibration etc.</p>
<p>-<strong>Date Type</strong>: What the date represents</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Related Identifier</strong>: PIDs that are related to the instrument. For example a complex instrument might contain sensors that can be considered to be instruments in their own right. These could have PIDInst minted for them and they would list the other sensors in the instrument as related identifiers</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Related Identifier Type</strong>: The type of PID included.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relation Type</strong>: Description of the relationship</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Alternate Identifier</strong>: Other Identifiers that the instrument has</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Alternate Identifier Type</strong>: The type of identifier used as an alternate</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition to the instrument metadata if the facility is also being onboarded then we need metadata associated with this. Currently there are no internationally recognised PIDs for facility or department scale institutions that lie under a larger research institution, such as a university. Work in this area is ongoing and there is some indication that the Research Organisation Registry (ROR) PID will be extended to include sub-units. As such, there is no agreed upon minimum metadata, other than the facility name. We have developed a skeleton facility profile to hold this data once consensus about what the minimum metadata standards are has been reached.</p>
<p>MyTardis has been developed with a very flexible metadata model that allows for nearly complete customisation of the metadata fields stored and presented by the system. This flexibility comes with the additional overhead, however, of needing to establish metadata schema for the different objects stored in the database. During the data gathering stage of the onboarding process, we work with researchers and facility managers to discover:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>What metadata exists for the data generated?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What data can be automatically obtained from the instrument or the output files from the instrument?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What metadata should be stored with the data? <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f2" id="id2">2</a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is useful for researchers to be able to search on?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any examples of international best practice that we can leverage?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What is the priority of the metadata, in other words, what is the best order to display it in? <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f3" id="id3">3</a></p></li>
<li><p>At what level in the object hierarchy of MyTardis should the metadata sit?</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Once this information has been gathered, appropriate metadata schema can be prepared within MyTardis and their identifier recorded.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="determining-an-ingestion-strategy">
<span id="ingestion-strat"></span><h2>Determining an Ingestion Strategy<a class="headerlink" href="#determining-an-ingestion-strategy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Concurrently with information gathering, onboarding a new instrument requires the development of an ingestion strategy. At it’s heart such a strategy needs to unambiguously assign metadata to the data files that are generated by an instrument.</p>
<p>This process is complicated by the presence of an object hierarchy within MyTardis and metadata needs to be sorted into it’s appropriate place within the object hierarchy.</p>
<p>With the <strong>project</strong> ‘app’ installed the object hierarchy in MyTardis is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Project.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment (It is often convenient to think of this as being a sample on which multiple assays, from different instruments, are being made).</p></li>
<li><p>Dataset (This represents a suite of measurement(s) taken using a single instrument for a related sample or samples).</p></li>
<li><p>Datafiles generated by the instrument (It is envisaged that little metadata will sit at this level of the object hierarchy, but it does provide a location for quality assurance data or similar to sit).</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For each level of the hierarchy the minimum metadata is similar, but has different names due to historical reasons.</p>
<p>At the Project level the minimum metadata is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>name</strong>: The project name</p></li>
<li><p><strong>description</strong>: A short project description</p></li>
<li><p><strong>identifier</strong>: A unique project identifier, can be multiple in use but all need to be globally unique within MyTardis. To help with global uniqueness we are recommending that facilities prepend their own identifiers with a 3 letter code representing the facility. This provides some protection against namespace collision.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>principal_investigator</strong>: A username for the lead researcher in the project. This user will get admin access at all levels of the project and it’s child objects. It should be noted that the UoA version of MyTardis authenticates against Active Directory and the API may need reworking for OAuth authentication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>schema</strong>: A schema name as defined within MyTardis for the Project level schema. This will include the metadata fields and short names associated with them.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For Experiments the minimum metadata required for them to be created in MyTardis is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>title</strong>: The experiment name</p></li>
<li><p><strong>identifier</strong>: A unique experiment identifier. See Project identifier field for notes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>description</strong>: A short description of the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>project</strong>: A <strong>list</strong> of project identifiers (i.e. the <strong>identifier</strong> field from the project object in question) for the parent projects. <em>Note:</em> Many-To-Many relationships are established between the Project and the Experiment objects, allowing for the ready re-use of data, as appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>schema</strong>: A schema name as defined within MyTardis for the Experiment level schema. This will include the metadata fields and short names associated with them.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For Datasets the minimum metatdata is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>description</strong>: The dataset name (see experiment <strong>title</strong> above)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>identifier</strong>: A unique dataset identifier, could also be Dataset DOIs. See Project:<strong>identifer</strong> for notes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>experiments</strong>: A <strong>list</strong> of experiment identifiers associated with the Experiment <strong>identifier</strong>. <em>Note:</em> Many-To-Many relationships are established between the Experiment and the Dataset objects, allowing for the ready re-use of data, as appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>instrument_id</strong>: A unique identifier to the instrument that the data was generated on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>schema</strong>: A schema name as defined within MyTardis for the Dataset level schema. This will include the metadata fields and short names associated with them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Datafile Object. (<em>NB</em>: Given the limitations associated with transferring data through the <em>html</em> interface of MyTardis, we are streaming the data directly into our object store, using the <strong>boto3</strong> python library, and the <strong>filehandler.py</strong> script provides wrapper functions to do this. We then create a <strong>replica</strong> in MyTardis that points to the file location.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>filename</strong>: The file name of the data file to be ingested</p></li>
<li><p><strong>md5sum</strong>: The MD5 checksum of the original data file</p></li>
<li><p><strong>storage_box</strong>: The MyTardis storage box defined for the facility</p></li>
<li><p><strong>local_path</strong>: The full path to the local instance of the data file to be ingested</p></li>
</ul>
<p>_ <strong>remote_path</strong>: The relative path to the remote instance of the data file for the purposes of maintaining the local directory structure. This is in place to accommodate analysis packages that expect a specific directory structure.
- <strong>full_path</strong>: The full path to the remote instance of the data file (normally constructed from the <strong>remote_path</strong> by the parser.
- <strong>schema</strong>: A schema name as defined within MyTardis for the Datafile level schema. This will include the metadata fields and short names associated with them.
- As with the project any additional keys will be added as metadata fields</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>There are a wide range of approaches that can be taken in order to match metadata to data and working with researchers and facility managers to integrate the ingestion process into their existing workflow is the goal of the co-design process. We have found, however, that the flexibility associated with the wide range of</p>
