# Datafile template. Please replace <key> with the metadata keys defined in the schema and <value> with its value
#
# Datafiles are a little different as they tend to be defined in blocks of files that are all associated with the same dataset
# If no dataset_id is needed as there is a well defined directory structure, and there is no file specific metadata, then this
# file can be left blank.
#
# Blocks of files can be tagged with the same dataset ids by defining a fileblock as shown below. Multiple fileblocks can be defined
# but these need unique keys, for example block_1:, block_2:

# Necessary info
datafiles:
  # If a rigorous directory structure is used then this can be inferred from the directory and only needs explicit definition if multiple samples are associated with the dataset
  dataset_id:
    - Test-dataset
  # schema: <value> - un-comment if multiple schema have been defined and set the appropriate type of schema
  files:
    - name: /remote/path/test_data.dat
      metadata:
        key1: value1
        key2: value2
    - name: /remote/path/test_data2.dat
