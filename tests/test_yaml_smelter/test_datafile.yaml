# Datafiles are a little different as they tend to be defined in blocks of files that are all associated with the same dataset
# If no dataset_id is needed as there is a well defined directory structure, and there is no file specific metadata, then this
# file can be left blank.
#
# Blocks of files can be tagged with the same dataset ids by defining a fileblock as shown below. Multiple fileblocks can be defined
# but these need to be separated as different YAML blocks via the ---
